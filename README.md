##NASA Video and Imagery API

This app allows for user interaction with selected photo categories from the NASA imagery API in a visually pleasing manner beyond what has been provided by the NASA site (https://images.nasa.gov/)

Visitors can view both collections of and single photos and videos as well as create, update and delete their own comments on each photo.

Future Goals: 
Stretch 1: Site visitors will be able to sign up/login as a registered user. Once logged in, usersand save their favorite NASA images/videos to their "Space Board". 

Stretch 2:: A supplementary AR app will render 3D models of selected NASA images, using the NASA image displayed on the screen as a marker.
